            <p>My name is Amanda. I am from Vancouver, B.C., Canada and currently pursuing my bachelor's degrees in Human Centered Design & Engineering, with a concentration in Human-Computer Interactions (HCI), and Psychology at the University of Washington in Seattle. The two majors merge my passions of creating, helping, and learning about human interactions and technology. </p>
            <p>Design, to me, is the art of creating a meaningful relationship between distinct components to elevate experiences. It should be motivated by benevolent intentions and take into consideration the potential impacts. Inspired by Dieter Rams' principles of good design, I aspire to use a functionalist perspective to research and create practical artifacts.</p>
