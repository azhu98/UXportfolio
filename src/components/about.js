            <p>My name is Amanda. I am from Vancouver, B.C., Canada and currently pursuing my bachelor's degrees in Human Centered Design & Engineering, with a concentration in Human-Computer Interactions (HCI), and Psychology at the University of Washington in Seattle. The two majors merge my passions of creating, helping, and learning about human interactions and technology. </p>
            <p>Design, to me, is the art of creating a meaningful relationship between distinct components to elevate experiences. It should be motivated by benevolent intentions and take into consideration the potential impacts. Inspired by <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/dieter-rams-10-timeless-commandments-for-good-design" target="_blank">Dieter Rams' principles of good design</a>, I aspire to use a functionalist perspective to research and create practical artifacts.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I love taking pictures and exploring. Check out pictures from some of my adventures<a href="http://www.amandazhu.org/photography" target="_blank"> here 📷🗺️</a>.</p>
